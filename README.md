This is a project I created a few years ago. I am working on improving it by adding comments, fixing errors, and generally making it cleaner.
The game itself has three stages. Players defeat enemies to gain experience, armor pieces, and gold. Experience gained unlocks new spells to use, better armor pieces reduce damage taken, and gold can buy stronger weapons. Once a player feels ready, they can challenge the boss of the stage they are currently in. Once they have defeated the boss, they move on to the next area. The game ends when the final boss is defeated.
